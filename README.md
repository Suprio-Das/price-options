## Project Overview

This project is a web application that provides information about various pricing options and displays student performance metrics for educational courses. The application includes a responsive navigation bar, pricing options, and a student performance chart using `Recharts`.

### Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **Recharts**: Library for building charts in React
- **React Icons**: Library for including popular icons in React projects

## Components

### 1. `App.js`
This is the main component that renders the `Navbar`, `PriceOptions`, and `StudentPerformance` components.

### 2. `Navbar.js`
This component renders the navigation bar with links to different routes. It uses state to manage the visibility of the menu in mobile view.

### 3. `PriceOptions.js`
This component fetches pricing options from a JSON file and displays them using the `PriceOption` component.

### 4. `PriceOption.js`
This component takes a pricing option as a prop and displays its details, including the name, price, and features. It uses the `Feature` component to list the features.

### 5. `Feature.js`
This component displays individual features of a pricing option, using icons from `React Icons`.

### 6. `StudentPerformance.js`
This component displays a bar chart of student performance metrics using `Recharts`.

### 7. `Link.js`
This component renders individual navigation links. It is used within the `Navbar` component.

## Data

The pricing options are stored in a JSON file (`priceOptions.json`), which includes information about different pricing tiers and their respective features.


## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository:**

```sh
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```sh
npm install
```

3. **Start the development server:**

```sh
npm start
```

4. **Open the application in your browser:**

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Future Improvements

- **Add Routing:** Implement React Router to handle different routes for "Home", "About", "Contact", and "User Profile" pages.
- **Enhance Styling:** Improve the design and responsiveness of the application using more Tailwind CSS features.
- **Expand Data:** Integrate with a backend service to fetch real-time data for pricing options and student performance metrics.
- **Add Testing:** Implement unit and integration tests to ensure the reliability and robustness of the application.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a basic structure for a React application with dynamic content fetching, responsive design, and data visualization. It can be further expanded and customized to meet specific requirements and use cases.
